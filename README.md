# DualA-Net: Image Segmentation Model Implementation

Medical image segmentation is a crucial tool in healthcare, essential for early disease detection and diagnosis. However, existing models struggle to balance accuracy, adaptability, and computational efficiency, limiting their application across various medical image segmentation tasks.

This project explores **DualA-Net**, a novel deep-learning architecture designed to enhance segmentation accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. The model was evaluated on the **CHASE DB1** dataset, demonstrating its ability to closely replicate ground truth segmentation masks. These findings highlight the potential of DualA-Net for real-world medical applications.
