# DualA-Net-Image-Segmentation-Model-Implementation
Medical image segmentation is a crucial tool in healthcare, essential for early disease detection and its diagnosis. This project explores DualA-Net, a novel deep-learning architecture designed to enhance segmentation accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. The model incorporates a dual-branch encoder, multi-scale skip connections, and an Adaptive Region Field Selection Decoder (ARFSD) module, which enable the model to intelligently adapt to and focus on the regions of interest, ensuring its adaptability. Several preprocessing and data augmentation techniques, including random flips, rotations, and contrast and brightness adjustments, were applied to improve generalization and reduce overfitting. 
The model was evaluated on the CHASE DB1 dataset, and the results obtained demonstrate its ability to closely replicate ground truth segmentation masks. These findings provide evidence of the effectiveness of DualA-Net in medical image segmentation and its potential for
deployment in real-world medical applications.
